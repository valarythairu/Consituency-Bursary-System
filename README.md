# Consituency-Bursary-System
The main objective of the project is to design a system that facilitates the process of bursary applications, awards, processing, and disbursements. The specific objectives of the project are as follows:

1. Enable applicants to apply for bursaries online: The system should provide an online platform where individuals can submit their bursary applications electronically.

2. Award bursaries through matching applicant's data with the system's ratings: The system should have a rating mechanism that evaluates the applicants based on specific criteria and matches them with the available bursaries for fair and efficient awarding.

3. Allocate disbursements to the most qualified applicants: Once the bursaries are awarded, the system should ensure that the disbursements are allocated to the most deserving and qualified applicants based on the established criteria.

4. Generate a report on the bursary disbursements every financial period: The system has reporting capabilities to generate periodic reports on the disbursements made, providing an overview of the financial activities related to the bursaries.

By achieving these objectives, the project aims to streamline the bursary process, make it more accessible through online applications, ensure fair awarding based on ratings, and provide transparent and accountable disbursements through regular reporting.

Moreover, the web application includes an email system, which enables seamless communication with applicants throughout the bursary process. Users are required to set up PHPMailer on their local PCs, configuring it with the appropriate SMTP settings specific to their email service provider. This ensures reliable and personalized email notifications, including application confirmations, bursary award notifications, and disbursement updates.
